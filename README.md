# getting started: daunted
Taking my first steps towards a future in programming and development meant updating all of my extremely outdated computer stuff- a seemingly simple enough task. 

For some reason, probably related to old phone-rooting projects, I never updated my personal computer beyond its first couple releases...f/p...updating from Sierra to Catalina took far longer than I planned; more hours than I wanted, and embarrassingly...more than a full day.  

A full 8 days before I would try and fail twice to update straight from Sierra to Catalina...an actual Help Desk Angel from Santa Clara Law (https://lawhelpdesk.scu.edu/support/solutions/articles/11000084217-i-m-still-running-mac-os-yosemite-or-el-capitan-how-do-i-upgrade-to-mac-os-catalina-), who foresaw my predicament, published a note recommending to upgrade FIRST to High Sierra and THEN to Mojave before attempting the Catalina 10.5.4 update....thank the lorDt because after 2 hours of waiting for my computer to respond, I was ready to GET GOING.

Several hours of downloading, unzipping, installing, repeating, and troubleshooting later and I'm here...a tattered, war-torn, weather-worn, programming VETERAN! I have been through the thick and thin of it, if I can survive this first day- nothing, absolutely NOTHING can stop me...

...I imagined my confident first steps toward a future in programming would be triumphant and validating; The Universe thotnot. hsdjfkhsjkfhk
